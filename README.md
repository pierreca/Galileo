This is a repository for my experiments with the Intel Galileo.

Right now there's only a 3D model that will make it easier for makers to design enclosures for their project (hopefully).

![Galileo v1 3D](http://raw.github.com/pierreca/galileo/master/images/galileo_v1_3d.png)

It fits perfectly in [this enclosure](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:159983)

![Galileo v1 3D with case](http://raw.github.com/pierreca/galileo/master/images/galileo_v1_with_case_3d.png)

I have found multiple other case or mount plates projects on thingiverse, strangely not all of them fit, even though the errors are usually of a millimeter or less. it may be a measurement instrument problem... 

Please report any issue and measurement error, and don't hesitate to contribute and make this model more accurate!
